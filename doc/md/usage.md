# Usage

Head to the **[Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org)** for information on how to use your Debian/GNU Linux system, notably:

 - [Package management](https://wiki.debian.org/PackageManagement) (installing/removing/upgrading software)
 - [Software](https://wiki.debian.org/Software)
 - [Xfce](https://wiki.debian.org/Xfce)

See the package lists in the sidebar for useful links about installed software.


## Maintenance & security

 * Only install software from your [package manager](https://wiki.debian.org/PackageManagement), do not run or install software or commands for untrusted sources
 * Backup your data periodically to an external storage using [Back In Time](https://backintime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html)
 * Only enter your administrator password to perform necessary system administration tasks
 * Use strong (long) passwords/phrases, do not reuse passwords for different services (use the [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) password manager), use secure network protocols (HTTPS, ...), use disk encryption
 * Security updates will be applied automatically [at least until 2022 and at most until 2024](https://www.debian.org/releases/) (unattended-upgrades)
 * Keep your hardware in good condition
